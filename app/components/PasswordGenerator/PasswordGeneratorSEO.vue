      Creating strong, secure passwords is essential to protecting your online accounts from
      <strong>cyber threats</strong> like brute force attacks, social engineering, and dictionary-based hacking.
      Our <strong>secure password generator</strong> helps you quickly generate random, complex passwords
      that meet the highest security standards. Here are some key tips and features to ensure your passwords
      stay uncracked and safe:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
      <li><strong>Avoid reusing passwords</strong> or security questions across multiple accounts,
          especially for sensitive platforms like banking or email.</li>
      <li>Generate passwords with <strong>at least 16 characters</strong>, using a mix of
          <em>uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols</em> to maximize strength.</li>
      <li><strong>Never use personal information</strong> (like names of pets, birthdays, or phone numbers)
          or easily guessable patterns.</li>
      <li>Examples of <strong>strong passwords</strong>: <code>z8Kr!LXmP$7^RfG1</code> or
          <code>D@pC9zN(T3*Y2H</code>. Avoid weak ones like <code>12345678</code>, <code>qwerty</code>,
          or <UField>password1</UField>.</li>
      <li><strong>Don’t store passwords</strong> in browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, or Safari)
          since they can be revealed through simple attacks.</li>
      <li><strong>Two-step authentication</strong> (2FA) is highly recommended for an extra layer of protection.</li>
      <li><strong>Use encrypted connections</strong> (e.g., HTTPS, SFTP, or VPN) when logging into important accounts,
          especially over public Wi-Fi or unknown networks.</li>
      <li>If managing many accounts, consider a <strong>password manager</strong> or store passwords securely in
          <strong>encrypted files</strong> using tools like <em>BitLocker or 7-Zip</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>Change passwords regularly</strong> (e.g., every 10 weeks) to stay ahead of potential threats.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Additional Tips for Password Security:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid <strong>similar passwords</strong> for different accounts (e.g., <code>iloveMusicApp</code>
          and <code>iloveBankApp</code>).</li>
      <li>Don’t rely on things you <strong>can’t change</strong>, like fingerprints, as passwords.</li>
      <li><strong>Beware of phishing sites</strong> by accessing important websites (like PayPal) via bookmarks or
          manually typing the URL.</li>
      <li><strong>Encrypt entire devices</strong> if they store sensitive data, and
          <strong>physically destroy old hard drives</strong> to prevent data leaks.</li>
      <li>Use <strong>virtual credit cards</strong> when shopping online to mitigate risks of stolen payment details.</li>
    </ul>
